Fero Király is an artist, performer and teacher. He deals with sound and music projects with an overlap into performance, sound art, visual art, installations, interpretations of contemporary music, as well as with educational projects in the field of sound art. He uses new frontier experimental positions, creates his own digital tools and likes to collaborate on projects with other artists with a multidisciplinary focus. He mapped the early works of Philip Glass’s minimal music, most of which he premiered in Slovakia – from clubs to the two largest cathedrals (Košice, Bratislava). Recently, he has been focusing on microtonality, livecoding and on installations and sound environments. In his latest sound installations [Chronika]({{< ref "/works/Chronika" >}} "Chronika") and [Water music III]({{< ref "/works/vodna_hudba_iii" >}} "Water music III"), he deals with the themes of language, time and new-new sensitivity.

He is one of the founders and artistic directors of an annual intermedia art /non/festival JAMA which takes place annually in autumn in Banská Štiavnica and Banská Belá, Slovakia – the last places of residence of Slovak intermedia artist Milan Adamčiak.


Fero Király was on residences in Santa Cruz, San Francisco, Druskininkai, Ljubljana and Poznan. Apart from Slovakia, he has performed in New York (Roulette Intermedium), San Francisco, London (Cafe OTO), Prague (National Theatre, UMPRUM), Berlin, Passau, Vienna (MUMOK), Oslo, Copenhagen and others. He has collaborated with artists and curators such as Milan Adamčiak, Hauke Harder, Michal Murin, Hilary Jeffery,  Maja Osojnik, Juraj Bartusz, Elliot Sharp, Lina Lapelyte and others.

His most famous projects include the {{< link "Cluster ensemble" "http://www.cluster-ensemble.com" >}} (together with Ivo Šiller and Zuzana Biščáková), where he co-authored a number of performances.

Recently, the collection has established itself in the space of Slovak basic art schools and has become a part of children's music education.
