A /non/festival \& sympozium happening on the intersection of intermedia, contemporary art and society. It focuses on presenting curated works by selected artists working in experimental fields. JAMA also develops site- and event-specific projects that are subsequently often "left behind" in Banská Belá, the last place of residence of Slovak composer and conceptual artist Milan Adamčiak (1946 – 2017), whose memory JAMA is dedicated to.

This project was founded by Eva Vozárova (director) and Fero Király (curator), with collaboration {{< link "Banská St a nica Contemporary" "http://www.banskastanica.sk/c/home/" >}}, Lucia Gregor Stach and others.
